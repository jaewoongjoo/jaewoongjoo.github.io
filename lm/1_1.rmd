##### Definition
Let $W$ be a subspace of $V$. The *orthogonal complement* of $W$ is 
$$
W^\perp:=\{ v \in V: v\perp w \mbox{ for all } w \in W\} 
$$
&nbsp;&nbsp;

##### Theorem 
Let $W$ be a subspace of $V$ and let $W^\perp$ be its orthogonal complement. Then

1. Every $x\in V$ can be written uniquely as $x=x_0+x_1$, with $x_0\in W$ and $x_1\in W^\perp$.

2. dim$(V)$=dim$(W)$+dim$(W^\perp)$.
