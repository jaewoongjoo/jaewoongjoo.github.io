Because I was a window OS user for more than 20 years, one of the strangest things as a beginner was about how to install programs. When you try to install in Linux,

- you can directly install in *terminal*,
- you are gonna be given files of the form *.deb* in the web (if you are a debian based Linux OS user),
- you are gonna be given files of the form *.tar.gz* in the web. 

<br>

When using terminal, many softwares may be installed with the package *apt-get*, such as 
```
$ sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base

```

<br>

When you get *.deb* files, you may use the *gdebi* packages to install, such as
```
$ sudo gdebi rstudio.deb
```
<br>

When you get *.tar.gz* files (ex. named by *rstudio.tar.gz*), you may type in terminal as below:

```
$ tar -xvzf rstudio.tar.gz
$ cd rstudio
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
