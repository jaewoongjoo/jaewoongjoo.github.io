This blog has nothing to do with someone using *Overleaf* as a *Latex* compiler. But, I am an *Emacs* user, and I would like to share my experience while installing Latex. When you start, you may first install *texlive* by typing in terminal as below:

```
$ sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base 
$ sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-recommended 
$ sudo apt-get install texlive-fonts-extra 
$ sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra 
```
<br>

Then, I discovered that *auctex* was not working in Emacs and that Emacs couldn't find the location of texlive. If so, you may include the following commands in your *.bashrc* file:

```
 if ! [[ "\$PATH" =~ "\$HOME/.local/bin:\$HOME/bin:" ]] 
 then 
     PATH="\$HOME/.local/bin:\$HOME/bin:\$PATH" 
 fi 
 export PATH 
 
 export PATH=\$PATH:/usr/share/texlive/2021/bin/x86_64-linux 
 export MANPATH=\$MANPATH:/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/doc/man 
 export INFOPATH=\$INFOPATH:/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/doc/info 
```

<br>

(This may only be working for the 2021 version of texlive.)
